Welcome to the first map progress! Before I go into what this includes, remember you can always [go to the github repo with the assests](https://github.com/Jailbreak-Scratch/assets)

In this update, I have added a court with a fence (fence incomplete) and a main building with a (to-be) clickable door. The background (currently) is only grass, but I will have sand and stone as I make the map.
