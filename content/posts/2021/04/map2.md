Horray! Another map update! This time, we are looking at what will eventually will be our main building. At the minute it's just a walkway into the cafeteria and there are benches to sit on.

The divide in the cafeteria is going to be where the food is served and it will be staff only behind it. There is also a door, which will be permantly there, since this is where you enter and exit!
