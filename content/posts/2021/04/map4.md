We are so close to finishing the main building! Soon we can move onto other maps neccessary for the game! This time, I have added the cells. At the minute, it isn't obvious, but soon, they will be added. Stairs are also yet to be added and what looks like to be a cell on the corner is actually a police gear up station.

Of course this needs gear, but, hey! The cells need bars, but they aren't there!

Other things that need finishing are the cafeteria, more specifically the staff area and the trays.
