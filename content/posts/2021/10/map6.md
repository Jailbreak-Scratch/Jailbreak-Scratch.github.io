Long time, no post, right? Well, on to the update

![Map 6](/images/Main-Building-Map5.webp)

This time, we have chairs and desks! As you may notice, the desks don't look like everything else...
This is because they were made in Blender. To be honest, I don't really like them, so I ask all readers to
[make their own fork of the project](https://github.com/Jailbreak-Scratch/assets) and make a desk based on the
style of the rest of the project!

I'll probably make a new update next year... Hopefully not.
